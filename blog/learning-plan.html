          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            I don’t want to be setting very specific job title/role goals. I am in this after not using my degree. My plan is to 
            gain entry into a tech role and explore the sphere of possibilities from there. It would be good to start talking to people 
            about what avenues there are though so I can target entry-level roles more specifically. Either way, I want to continue 
            to grow my skills so that I have some security. Not the security of the same job for an extended period, but the security 
            of knowing that my skills are still relevant and in demand.
          </p>
          <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning.</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Strengths:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>I have a great curiosity for technical stuff.</li>
              <li>I can keep truckin’ when I hit a snag.</li>
              <li>I enjoy the material.</li>
              <li>I can lose hours as I am so focused on the problem.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Limitations:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>When I do hit a snag, I often feel quite stupid. I keep going but feel stupid for taking too long.</li>
              <li>I get fixated on a first solution.</li> 
              <li>I struggle to pause and follow a problem-solving framework.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Non-violent communication skills. Please google this if you are ??</li>
              <li>How to get extremely clear on a team about who is responsible for what.</li>
              <li>When and how to hold another person accountable.</li>
              <li>Time-management.</li>
              <li>Networking.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>I am fully committed time-wise and have cleared all conflicts. I will allocate some time to maintaining my relationships with my partner and key friends.</li>
              <li>I have started implementing many of the suggested learning habits. Meditating, goal setting, reflection. This combined with my time commitment will hopefully see me through.</li>
              <li>I will conduct myself with compassion and professionalism around all co-learners, educators and other community members.</li>
              <li>When things start getting to me I will ask for help to prioritise what is essential and also to get a fresh perspective on how I might divide the problems.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
          <p>
            I will develop relationships with my co-learners, asking for help either in person or on slack. If the problem is bigger, 
            unsolvable or not appropriate for them I will reach out to a facilitator or tutor through those same channels.
          </p>
          <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Honest qualitative feedback.</li>
              <li>Suggestions on where I personally might stretch my competencies and where my knowledge and skill gaps are.</li>
              <li>Perspective on what's important.</li>
              <li>Hold me to a high standard. That is a big one for me.</li>
            </ul>
