          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? ---update---</h3>
          <p>
            I am in this after not using my degree which was extremely niche. So I am a bit burnt on making overly specific plans before
            I have a better understanding of the sphere. 
            My plan is to gain entry into a tech role and explore the sphere of possibilities from there. 
            Community contribution: I would like to use my newly learned skills to help non-profits. So many fantastic initiatives out there 
            need tech help.

              <li>I get fixated on a first solution.</li> 
              <li>I struggle to pause and follow a problem-solving framework.</li>
              <li>My design sense and will to beautify things is weak in the face of CSS.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? ---updated--</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Non-violent communication skills. Please google this if you are ??</li>
              <li>How to get extremely clear on a team about who is responsible for what.</li>

              <li>Networking.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. ---updated--</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>I am fully committed time-wise and have cleared all conflicts. I will allocate some time to maintaining my relationships with my partner and key friends.</li>
              <li>First day of Bootcamp is my birthday so I am looking forward to it!</li>
              <li>I have started implementing many of the suggested learning habits. Meditating, goal setting, reflection. This combined with my time commitment will hopefully see me through.</li>
              <li>I will conduct myself with compassion and professionalism around all co-learners, educators and other community members.</li>
              <li>When things start getting to me I will ask for help to prioritise what is essential and also to get a fresh perspective on how I might divide the problems.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
          <p>
            I will develop relationships with my co-learners, asking for help in person and if not possible on slack. If the problem is bigger, 
            unsolvable or not appropriate for them I will reach out to a facilitator or tutor through those same channels.
          </p>
          <h3>A description of what you expect from the Bootcamp team ---updated--</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Honest feedback.</li>
              <li>I don't want to just meet some standard, I want to get the very best out of myself and would appreciate tutors who are willing to push and pull that out of me.</li>
              <li>Hold me to a high standard. That is a big one for me.</li>
              <li>Perspective on what's important.</li>
              
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
          <p>
            Collaborating on projects. In the past I have had awful experiences where some people don't show up in a real way.
            Effective collaboration was not taught. Methods and tools for collaboration will be great. I know it will be part of Human Skills in 
            some form. :)
