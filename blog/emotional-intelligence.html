          <h3>So what is it?</h3>
          <p>
            A simple and uncomprehensive definition:
            <br> 
            Emotional Intelligence is the ability to be aware of your own emotions and the emotions of others and then use that awareness to 
            understand and act. Practice empathy to understand others.
            <br>
            General Intelligence is the ability to process non-emotional information, use it and reason with it quickly. 
            <br>
            Substantial evidence shows that Emotional Intelligence is an important indicator of a person's potential success in life, 
            especially in leadership.            
          </p>
          <h3>My personal experience and notes on mindfulness, happiness and self-mastery.</h3>
          <p>
            <h4>Self-awareness leads to self-mastery.</h4>
            
            By training our awareness on our body we can tune into our emotions. All emotion is held in the body. When you are present in your body
             it is remarkable where you find tension. In your jaw, shoulders, back, face. The awareness you bring to each relaxes them giving you calm
              emotions. With training, we get faster at recognising reactions in ourselves. The world is full of stimuli and we are constantly
               reacting out of habit. We can interrupt that and react with equanimity. Other useful mental habits include an active dialogue with 
               our ego. The judgemental and critical voice that for most people is the default of their mind. Have you ever noticed how the most
                judgemental people are the most unhappy? Their ego is more critical of themselves than others.
            
            <h4>Happiness</h4>
            
            “A deep sense of flourishing that arises from an exceptionally healthy mind… not a mere pleasurable feeling, a fleeting emotion, or a 
            mood, but an optimal state of being.” - Matthieu Riard
            <br><br>
            I can remember times of being in something like that state. A sense of great possibility and confidence in the future. A good nights sleep
             helps. I don’t know that my ego was really there. Strengths and limitations weren’t really in the foreground.
            <br><br>
            Is happiness the best choice for the highest goal for humans? 
            <br><br> 
            Depends on your definition and also personal beliefs about why we are on this spinning rock.
           
            We make our own truth. It is not objective because there is no objective truth in this sphere.
            WE choose what is meaningful. This understanding makes it very important that we are conscious of every bit of influence in our lives. Let
             it be your choice not the gusting winds of society.
           
            For me, happiness then keys into a life deliberately lived. And this does not conflict with the above definition of flourishing and the 
            state of flow, confidence and power.             
            
            <h4>Mindfulness</h4>
            
            To observe the present moment, non-judgementally.
            It is a challenge enough to not think of the past or future, but to not judge? That is the mountain.
            If you are angry, do you keep feeding it? Do you beat yourself up for feeling that way? Mindfulness can teach you to stay present and 
            observe the emotion in your body. By only observing, not making an evaluation or judgement about whether you are right or wrong, or good 
            or bad, you can just be with it. All the power of the emotion will fade. It is not instant, you are holding it in your body, but if you 
            don’t react, have confidence it will pass.
            
            <h4>Looping</h4>
            
            Repeating back what you heard the other say.
            Wow. It is so automatic to parse meaning through our lifetime of experiences. I don’t know that I can repeat back two minutes of 
            expression without internalising and spewing out my spin based on my faulty memory. If I can’t remember what they said clearly enough 
            my brain will make it up and in that process will interpret it through my experience.
