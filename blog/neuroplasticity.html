          <h3>What is Neuroplasticity and why is it important?</h3>
          <p>
            Years ago I read The Brain that Changes Itself by Norman Doidge. It was a fascinating read that delved into the science and the stories of success treating all sorts of neuroatypical people.
            One of the big takeaways was that to stay sharp and stave off degenerative mental ageing you must continuously learn through life. Learn French at age 65 sort of thing.            
          </p>
          <p>
            The brain is changeable. It grows and shapes itself continuously throughout our lives. It evolved to be efficient so that neural pathways that were neglected were pruned to make space and energy for the pathways that are deemed important. We have some control over what our brains deem important. This takes conscious effort. 
          </p>
          <p>
            People benefit from even just learning about neuroplasticity because it can challenge deep-seated beliefs about fixed potential. More on that in the discussion about growth mindset. 
The other way to benefit is to be deliberate in exercising neural pathways we value, through spaced repetition and more importantly linking new knowledge to old knowledge. Learning something new will create a new pathway but linking it to existing knowledge will create something stronger. Every time we touch a part of that neural pathway we potentially fire and therefore strengthen the whole. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For myself, I need to slow down and make the effort to tie new knowledge to old knowledge. 
I also need to be deliberate in converting my notes into spaced-repetition cards. And to ensure that my learning is either sufficiently novel or challenging to keep me engaged.

          <h3>Growth Mindset - What it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
          <p>
            Fixed Mindset: Intelligence is static. Your potential is limited. If you believe this you become consumed by the perceptions of your abilities. Every situation drives you to seek confirmation that you are not deficient. You must spend your energy to make sure you are not perceived as dumb. Effort is short-lived in the face of challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growth Mindset: Intelligence can be developed. You welcome challenge and see effort as the path to success. You don’t waste your energy on managing perceptions, but spend it on learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Did anything change for me?
          </p>
          <p>
            I always listened to Dr Dweck's work and reflected on it only in the context of intelligence. But personality? Can your personality grow?
That made me reflect. I have changed a fair bit. I am less pretentious, more generous, kinder in word and deed. More thoughtful. More confident. What's to say I can’t become a much kinder and also more dynamic personality?
          </p>
          <p>
            I also discovered that we can have both mindsets. We can believe in growth at work, but maybe not in health. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Confidence is just displayed ability.
          </p>
          <p>
            “...this was the first time I thought about confidence, willpower, determination, and perseverance as qualities that could be developed through your actions.” - James Clear
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the inverse of most teaching on confidence, where believing in yourself first is seen as the foundation.
            <br>
            In some aspects of my life, I exhibit this belief. Understanding that confidence comes through doing something until you know for a certainty that you can do it. I remember who first made it conscious for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this idea is new to me: that you can focus on breaking down the larger mindset by focussing and displaying to yourself smaller abilities. It would also help to be conscious and affirm these small abilities when you do display them.
          </p>
          <p>
            What are all the ways I wish I had more confidence?
          </p>
          <p> I won't exhaust you reader with a full list. <br>I wish I believed I could create healthy new enduring habits.</p>

          <p>How will I apply this?</p>
          <p>
            It will come down to implementing the idea that confidence is just displayed ability. Also reflecting on my ability to grow and not just take small changes foregranted, to be more generous to myself about small wins.
          </p>
          <p>It helps to reflect on the fact that you are literally wasting your time and life energy instead of actually just improving and overcoming deficiencies. 
          </p>
          <p>
            “Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you? The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives.” - Carol Dweck

          </p>
          <p>Does this affect my learning plan?</p>
          <p>
            Yes, it has hammered home that the quality of my reflections and a regular habit of it will be critical to cultivating this mindset. To remember to not waste my time on confirming my intelligence. Without reflection and gratitude, my default fixed mindset will dominate.
