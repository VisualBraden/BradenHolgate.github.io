          <h3>Describe your core personal values.</h3>
          <p>I categorise values into intrinsic and aspirational. I have noticed that what I admire in people are the values they demonstrate. 
            So I looked at my friends to understand what it was that deeply attracts me.
             The first is kindness, conscious kindness. They are openly kind and generous and take great care in their speech and actions to do no harm. 
             The second is intelligence both IQ and EQ, all in different ways my friends are very sharp. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I used to believe that I was more introverted than extroverted, however, over the last few years as I have put intention into cultivating friendships my belief has flipped.
            Belonging (is it a need or a value, I don’t know) is very important to me and I draw great energy from being around people.
          </p>
          <h4>Intrinsic Values:</h4>
          <p>
            I asked a friend what he thought my values were and his (and his partner’s haha) response was surprisingly quick. It also matched what I had put on paper about myself.
             Fairness/Integrity. I will speak out if something or someone is not being fair and honest in speech or action.
              That is deep-rooted, it ties into fundamental values of honesty and ownership of your situation
          </p>
          <p>
            I also exhibit a strong truth-seeking pattern which is the second value my friend pointed out. I value a deep understanding of the concepts and world.
             Not to say that I don’t have wide-ranging curiosity but when I learn or talk about a topic I prefer depth.
          </p>
          <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
          <p>
            I have moved around a fair bit. From South Africa at age ten and then on to Australia, the USA and Canada when I was 20.
             I feel that the cultures that dominated my values are the religious culture I was born in, the culture of prestige and achievement at Westlake Boy’s High,
              the outdoors one and also the activist culture my partner comes from.
          </p>
          <p>
            My early religion taught me that God is all-knowing and that his book contains the singular truth and it can only be interpreted correctly one way. 
            This rigid thinking still plays out unconsciously despite a conscious effort to empathise and actively consider other views. I have come a long way but it's still there. 
            One great counter-balance was the activist culture I haphazardly joined in Vancouver. There rigorous debate amongst campaigners on every imaginable topic sharpened me.
             The understanding of subjective versus objective truth really comes home when you get to the bedrock of a disagreement.
          </p>
          <p> 
            Early on I was told I was smart, it was even written into a poem about me. The school rewarded me for traditional academic success. 
            WBHS put achievement and academic success high on a pedestal and I chased the carrot. 
            This all fostered a fixed mindset in me and listening to podcasts with Carol Dweck shook me deeply. I have to work quite hard to get into a growth mindset.
          </p>
          <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
            the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I cannot think of a specific situation. My memory is not great like this. I have never had to make important ethical decisions.
             Have I lied and cheated before, definitely, in weakness I have.  
             <br>
             One positive example is that when I do think the rules make sense, out of fairness I am compelled to follow them. Mask-wearing, isolation, distancing, vaccination
          </p>
          <h3>
            Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
          </h3>
          <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>I can slog through drudgery in the pursuit of my studies. </li>
              <li>I can take the written word and absorb abstractions.</li>
              <li>I am drawn into interesting problems and can lose hours before emerging.</li>
              <li>Strong commitment to ownership of my words and actions.</li>
            </ul>
          <h4>Limitations</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>I have a bad case of Imposter Syndrome, I know it, but it is difficult to act differently.
                 My last boss’s final advice was that I should get out of my own way, I am competent and should feel good about it.
              </li>
              <li>Have a hard time empathising with people who are not showing up, taking ownership of their situation or being unfair.</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
          <p>In traditional learning I am successful. I have an engineering degree to show for it. You must be okay with drudgery and textbooks and typography from the 70’s. 
            Outside that structure I do struggle. Lack of confidence and imposter syndrome get in the way of me making strides in self-driven learning.
          </p>
          <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
          <p> The habits I am now learning on this course will hopefully become deeply seated. This course combines a little bit of structure and accountability with the flipped learning model. 
            This is what I need. After the course, I will need to find other ways of holding myself accountable. 
            Like when I say out loud that I will go to the gym x amount of time this week. If I say that to the right people I will do it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily for me the problems and tasks of this course are drawing me in and pulling me in. I have very little inertia to get studying in the morning.
             My biggest challenge will be to maintain a growth mindset as the course becomes more challenging. I will need to be more resilient when I just don’t get it.
              I have never given up but that is not the same as believing you will get it with work. 
          </p>
          <h3>
            Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
             Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
          </h3>
          <p>
            After a few months as the manager at the brewery, I had gotten over some of the initial humps and was starting to imagine how the business might move forward. 
            Our advertising was close to non-existent and as I worked on a strategy to get it going I was persuaded that the brand itself needed work. 
            There was resistance from the owner. At that time I didn’t deeply understand the roots of his resistance and tried to move forward but could only do so tentatively and
             without executive confidence because of him and my imposter syndrome. This effort stumbled and dragged on. Eventually, I understood how badly he had been burned 
             by people making marketing promises. He had a deep distrust of giving people money without a guarantee of quality. There are no guarantees to be had, but I could
              definitely have worked harder to understand his resistance and then addressed it directly with a strategy to mitigate the potential for a poor result. Confidence 
              came from experience and perspective change.
