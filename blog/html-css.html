          <h3>Fixed Postion</h3>
          <p>
            Fixed positioning is the simplest. You fix and elements position relative to the viewport.
             There can be issues if this position forces more dynamically positioned elements into undesirable configurations or overlaps.
          </p>
          <h3>Relative Position</h3>
          <p>
            Relative positioning refers to how an element appears relative to its own position in the HTML document. So it is relative to itself.
             This property will also place the element on top of any static element, so watch out. It gives you access to the z-index to dictate the order that
              elements appear in but this has limitations.
          </p>
          <h3>Absolute Position</h3>
          <p>
            Absolute positioning is not done relative to itself but rather relative to the closest parent element with the property of “position: relative”. 
            If it cannot find a parent with this property it will be relative to the HTML document, the page itself. It will move in a defined way relative to
             that parent even as the parent moves. In this way, you must be aware that when using relative blog
            positioning you will limit the possibilities in absolute positioning of any child.
