          <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            I really need to appear smart or at least competent from the get-go. If I know I can’t I often choose not to play.
            <br>
            My ego DOES NOT WANT TO CHANGE. I have learnt this before and will always need to keep learning it.
            <br>
            I struggle to appreciate the things I do well, and so when it comes to trying to create self-love my inner voice
             is deeply critical. It mocks me for doing any exercise that tries to shift a belief about myself.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <p>
            You need to understand what drives you, your values. When you don’t live your values you feel disconnected from life. 
            Much conflict boils down to differing values. We often unconsciously assign fault to others for not living by our values. 
            If you are not aware of this it makes you very hard to work with. 
            <br>
            Do not judge a person unless you have walked a mile in their shoes. Without active empathy and emotional intelligence, you 
            are bound to clash with others. If you are not self-aware you will struggle to identify why you are struggling or to take 
            ownership of your effect on others.
          </p>
          <h3>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            I am surprised at how effective it has been at changing how I operate in such a short time.
            <br>
            My mindset is not just fixed or growth. It is a little bit of this or that depending on the context. 
            It is most evidenced for me in my need to be perceived as smart and getting great deliverables out there. 
            That has been a shift for me to make, reflecting and cherishing internal progress over external outcomes.
          </p>
          <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Values Exploration</strong><br>
            There were lots of values that I have that I don’t like. Confronting that is not pleasant. <br>
            <strong>Mindset Shift</strong> <br>
            Trying to convince myself that I could change.
          </p>
          <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web 
            development Bootcamp course?</h3>
          <p>
            Habits of mind that make you more aware of what you are actually thinking and doing make you more productive and better to work with. 
            If you cannot work well with others your utility to a team is limited. This learning also contains the tools to make you resilient in the 
            face of great challenge.
          </p>
          <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming 
            instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
          <p>
            Some of it did. Not everything is for everyone. We all take different things from the material and when something doesn’t really land it is 
            just knowledge and never becomes wisdom. Some of it was also a bit old hat for me. But, I enjoyed taking a fresh look and taking the time to 
            put things down in writing.
            <br>
            The structure of required reflection has really helped me. Mindful awareness while learning has greatly improved my ability to problem-solve. 
            I find great satisfaction now when I catch myself being anxious to be something, or when I notice that I am avoiding the hard way. Noticing 
            things in the moment and pausing and reflecting on it is truly satisfying and meaningful to me in ways far beyond the scope of this course. 
            I am quite grateful that this is a part of the course.
