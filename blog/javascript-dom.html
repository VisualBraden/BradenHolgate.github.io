          <h3>What's the difference between HTML and CSS?</h3>
            <p>
            HTML is just a fancy way to format text. Kind of like in Word you type out a bunch of text and then to make it readable you create headings,
            subheadings, paragraphs, bold and italicise important bits and so on. HTML is the way we format text on a webpage. But CSS is the way we get fancy with it. 
            <br><br>
            With just HTML you can make great websites like this:
            <br><br>
            <img src="/media/stripped.jpg" alt="Amazing HTML" class="stripped">
            <br><br>
            With CSS it becomes this beauty:
            <br><br>
            <img src="/media/unstripped.jpg" alt="Decorated html with CSS" class="unstripped">
            <br><br>
            </p>
          <h3>Okay, I get that, but whats with this DOM? It sounds intimidating. </h3>
            <p>
            DOM stands for Document Object Model. 
            <br>
            It is an interface that has been created so that Javascript (and other languages) can manipulate a pages HTML and CSS. 
            Javascript is a language that lets you program in logic and functions, which we will learn about later. But what's an interface?
            <br>
            Imagine you are Javascript and you are in Webland and need to talk to HTML and CSS. You can use hand gestures and facial expressions to
             communicate but that only gets you so far. Enter spoken language, it has structure and rules but allows you to communicate far more information. 
             That is your interface, that is the DOM. It is a powerful way to interact, communicate and manipulate HTML and CSS.
            <br>
            The DOM itself is created as an object and is filled by a tree-like structure of child objects.
            You might interact with the DOM using Javascript to quickly find all instances of a certain type of styling in the HTML document and 
            using the special tools of the DOM change them all to a different type of styling.
            </p>
          <h3>Coool right??? So what else can you do with Javascript? </h3>
            <p>
            With Javascript, you can write all sorts of programs that create and compute all sorts of fun things.
            It utilises code logic with flow control and functions to make the magic happen.    
            <br>
            Imagine your body and mind are a program. The program's job is to keep you alive while studying at Devacademy. At the start of the program, you are at your 
            desk coding. 
            The program has instructions that say: if thirsty then drink water.
            An event occurs in your mouth, after your third coffee of the day, it feels dry and triggers the instructions.
            The program says “drink some water”.
            That's a bit of flow control logic right there.
            <br>
            The program also has a bit of logic built-in called a loop.
            The loop will keep checking again and again whether you are thirsty and keep telling you to drink water until you are hydrated,
            and then exit the loop. 
            The program then says ‘keep studying you clever ape’.
            <br>
            While you were gluggin’ water it was all being filtered through your gut into your bloodstream.
            Now you have all sorts of things floating about in their, water, nutrients and a cafe’s worth of caffeine.
            Hmm.. the program needs a filter. Let's call this filter a Liver. We code in the Liver. It rids the blood of the caffeine. Job done liver, excellent work, 
            see ya later. You drink another cup of coffee (why do punish yourself like this?). And you need the Liver back. Oh boy, that was a lot of work coding in the
            Liver to do its job. Wish we could just call it back and skip this labour.
            Oh, snap! That's a function! If we code it right we can just call the hardworking Liver back into action at any time.                                  
            </p>
            <h3>Your program also needs a way to store info. Enter Variables, Arrrays and Objects. </h3>
            <p>
              Say you wanted a neat way to record the stock of fruit in your cupboard.
              We could create a document called fruit-in-cupboard and inside create a list.
             That list would be ‘apples’, ‘oranges’, ‘pears’. 
             Now there's a twist. You are a program and the only way you can read this document is by checking each item at a time using its position on the list. 
             So you ask: What is at position 0? Poof! You can see that there are apples in the document.
             Position 0? Yep, that's right position 0. You are a program and you like to start counting from 0.
             So when you ask what is at position 2 you can see that there are pears in the cupboard.
             You just used an array.
             <br>
             But say you wanted to record not just whether you had a particular fruit in the cupboard but the stock of each fruit. 
             You could use an array: ‘apples’, 1, ‘oranges’, 4, ‘pears’, 2.
             But it might get confusing you would have to remember the order you wrote it in to make sure you didn’t assign the stock number to the wrong fruit. 
             Enter an Object.
             An object is a way to bind two pieces of info together. One bit is the item you are tracking: the key, and the other is its value which in this case 
             is your stock.
             So now your list looks like this: <br>
             Apples: 1, <br>
             Oranges: 4, <br>
             Pears: 2 <br>
             So now you, the program have a near way to see the stock in the cupboard. You can read the object and see that there are apples, oranges and pears. 
             If you want to know the stock of each you ask (pass in the key) of apples and out pops the value of 1. Handy!
