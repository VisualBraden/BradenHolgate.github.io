          <h3>The big block and how I plumbed it</h3>
          <p>
            When I was coding the fizzbuzz function I thought I had a good handle on switch statements. 
            A switch statement is a neat tool that uses a very clear structure to execute a bit of code only if it matches what you want. 
            This is a conditional statement. The bit of code will only run if it meets the condition. There are many methods that use conditional 
            statements and some of them have specific rules about how and where you check that the condition is met. 
            <br><br>
            The classic conditional is the ‘if’ statement which looks like this:
            <pre>
              <code>
if (sandwich is equal to tasty) {
  eat the sandwich;
}
              </code>
            </pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can see that in the brackets after the statement ‘if’ you evaluate whether something matches the condition. 
            Now sometimes if you have lots of different potential scenarios the if statements can get confusing. 
            That’s where ‘switch’ statements come in handy, they look like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
switch(Number.isInteger(num/3)) {
  case true:
    return "Fizz";
}
            
switch(Number.isInteger(num/5)) {
  case true:
    return "Buzz";
}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            You can see you give the statement something to check, and it will go through the cases looking for a match. This is nice and neat. 
            <br>
            When I was trying to use the switch statement, for some unknown reason, I treated the field where you state the case you are wanting to 
            check like it was an ‘if’ statement. I put a statement to be evaluated in each case scenario. I was a bit confused because this seemed 
            a bit too similar to if statements. In other words, I was blocked. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How did I overcome?</strong> I stepped back and got a snack. Mmmhmm. By not being in front of my screen for a minute a bit of awareness crept in. 
            Why was the switch statement looking like an if statement? When I got back to my desk I typed the question into pseudocode. This is kind 
            of like the rubber ducky method, but telling it to the screen. I had read the switch statement documentation over a few times but missed 
            the glaringly obvious. Now I saw it. The switch statement doesn’t evaluate an expression in each case. It just checks whether the case 
            matches the condition in the head of the statement!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I felt a bit stupid.</strong> Not for mixing up switch statements with if statements, but for not tuning in to the feeling 
            of “something is off - why is this like an if statement?”
            I have learnt to be more attuned to that instinct. I have also learned that I need to move on to another problem-solving tactic much 
            faster than I am naturally inclined to do. If I just sit and stare at the problem it is too easy for pieces of the puzzle to get 
            mixed up and I drift for ages.
            <br>
            That’s the beauty of the framework, it gives you a path to follow.  
          </p>
          <h3>When I was a classy coder and not a block head</h3>
          <p>
            I was happy with my solution to the averaging function in JS-Gradebook. You can see it below:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
function average(arr) {
  return ((arr.reduce((acc, int) 
  => acc + int, 0))/ arr.length)
}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            It is a simple enough bit of logic, but there can be verbose solutions.
            Mine utilised my knowledge of a reducing function that is built into the javascript language.
            I also used a newly learned way of writing my own functions called arrow functions which needs far fewer words to write. 
            This meant that my logic all fits on one clean line.
            I used the .reduce method's documentation to ensure my syntax was correct. 
            I felt great that I was getting the hang of the built-in methods and my ability to read documentation is strengthening. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I learnt that the informative naming of variables is vital to not getting mixed in the syntax.
            If your code is all “x, y, ! and >_+=”  it becomes very hard to read. The reduce method works by executing a function on your 
            input and then returning that result to be used in the next round of calculations. You could name that returned result ‘x’ if you wanted. 
            But then when you go to write the function that uses x you have to always think: “wait, what was x again, oh x is the returned result, 
            and I only know that because of where it is placed.” Instead, I named it ‘acc’ short for accumulator, because that is what it does it 
            accumulates the values of each round of calculations. So when I am writing the function out and using ‘acc’ I don’t have to think about 
            what it represents.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also happy with my solution to superfizzbuzz. Using a neat built-in method to call the fizzbuzz function on each element of the 
            input array.
          </p>
          <h3>How did I find each of the problem-solving techniques?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
            <br>
            My favourite technique. You can use it to word vomit a bit. Writing is hard, editing is easy.
            I use my comments to break down the problem and talk to myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Trying Something</strong>
            <br>
            Only after good planning. I will say that tweaking this and that before you understand something moves the process along faster.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Rubber Ducky method</strong>
            <br>  
            Alas, I don’t have the duck. So I talk to my code instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Reading Error Messages</strong>
            <br> 
            Can help. What the heck is a destructuring error??!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Console.logging</strong>
            <br>  
            Constantly. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Googling</strong>
            <br>
            I go straight for the documentation in Mozilla.
            At this stage, I try to avoid searching for complete solutions as I won’t learn anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>
            <br> 
            I am making strides. Not just reflecting at the end of an exercise, 
            but being aware at the moment I have a little ‘aha’ to pause and reflect and take notes.
          </p>
          <br><br>

            That's all folks!
